Testing Temperature and Comparing it to the Temperature Gun

Wanting to make a realiable remote temperature sensor that would realiably record temperature of the object, that would match the tempereature gun that i have
been using since the start. The Temperature gun, gives a us a realiable temperature, the latest test, we measure the temperature desk temperature and the 
temperature gun ranges from 18 - 21,The temperature sesnor ranges from 12 - 20. Which is a large difference. 

## 15-06 Test 1
Running the device for 3 and half hours (15 minute intervals) At about 9cm Height
| Measurements |Average   | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Temperature Gun  | 18.4
| Temperature Sensor | 16.54 | 
| Average | 2.7  | 

## 16-06 Test 2
Running the device for 5 and half hours (10 minute intervals) At about 9cm Height. Comparing the average from Test 1 to Output we got for this test.
| Measurements |Average   | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Temperature Gun  | 19.6
| Temperature Sensor | 16.8 | 
| Temperature Sensor + Difference | 18.6 | 
| Temperature Sensor + Test 1 Average | 19.5 | 
| Average | 2.2  | 
<br>
Temperature Sensor + Difference (Is the output - Temperature Sensor Difference)
This Test was highly encouraging because the averages were 0.1 of a difference when we used the Test 1 Average.
Issue that we need to account for is, that the range for the Test 1 Average + Temperature was 16-23 and Temperature Gun was 18 - 22. Which meant that some of the recording were outside the normal.
